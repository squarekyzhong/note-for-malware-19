# note-for-malware-19

No matter how sophisticated a packer may evolve, malware payload always interacts with Windows OS to perform malicious behavior(eg., code remote injection and ransomware's file encryption)

packer usually removes the payload's import address table to impede reverse engineering. Afterwards, the unpacking routine will obtain each API's address and rebuild the IAT at run time. In this way, the restored payload can invoke Windows APIs properly.

When a packed binary starts running, the original code is written in memory pages sometime and then get executed.(written-then-executed)

If an API is invoked through looking up a rebuilt IAT, it indicates that the original code has been restored, and the control flow has reached OEP already.(rebuilt-then-called)

The end of unpacking:
1. the reconstruction of payload IAT happens ahead of the jump to OEP
2. at run time, if an API is called through a rebuilt IAT rather than the unpacking routine IAT, it indicates that malware payload has been restored.

The advantages of stolen code:
As many user-level API hooking techniques identify their target API calls by matching the virtual addresses where these APIs are expected to locate, stolen code will make such API hooking tools miss the target.
