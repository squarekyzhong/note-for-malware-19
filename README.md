# note-for-malware-19

No matter how sophisticated a packer may evolve, malware payload always interacts with Windows OS to perform malicious behavior(eg., code remote injection and ransomware's file encryption)

packer usually removes the payload's import address table to impede reverse engineering. Afterwards, the unpacking routine will obtain each API's address and rebuild the IAT at run time. In this way, the restored payload can invoke Windows APIs properly.
